                        <h4> Kare-Kare (Filipino Oxtail and Peanut Stew with Vegetables) </h4>
                        <p>kare-Kare is the classic Filipino peanut stew filled with slices of oxtail, beef tripe, and an abundance of vegetables like long green beans, eggplants, Chinese cabbage, and banana heart simmered in a rich, thick, nutty sauce.</p>

                        <h4>Process</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Place 2 pounds oxtails and 2 pounds beef short ribs in a large bowl. Add enough cold water to cover and let sit for 20 minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Drain and place the meats in a large stockpot. Add 2 (32-ounce) cartons low-sodium beef broth, 3 cups water, 4 peeled garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Stir to combine.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Keep covered and cook until the meats are tender, about 2 hours. (If not finishing the kare-kare on the same day, uncover and let cool for 1 hour. Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours or up to overnight.)
                            </li>
                            <h3>Make the peanut sauce:</h3>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Skim off the fat from the top of the oxtails and short ribs and discard. (If refrigerated, the fat will be hardened. Skim it off, place the pot back over medium heat, and heat until just warmed through. Turn off the heat.) Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the oxtail and short ribs to a large bowl and reserve the cooking liquid (beef stock).

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Transfer 1/2 cup of the warm beef stock to a small bowl, add 1 1/2 tablespoons annatto powder, and stir until smooth.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Place 1/2 cup mochiko rice flour in a large pot or Dutch oven. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until light golden-brown and it has a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a second small bowl (reserve the pot), add 1 cup of the beef stock, and stir until smooth.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Mince 8 garlic cloves (about 3 tablespoons). Dice 1 medium yellow or white onion (about 1 1/2 cups).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in the same pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and onion and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Add the annatto mixture and stir to combine. Add the rice flour mixture and stir to combine.
                            </li>
                            <li>Add 2 cups creamy peanut butter, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Stir until combined. Add 4 cups of the beef stock and whisk until smooth, creamy, and thick. Whisk in 1/2 to 1 cup more beef stock if needed if it’s too thick to whisk. Bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring often and reducing the 
                                heat as needed, for 5 to 8 minutes for the flavors to meld.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Finish the kare-kare:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>While the sauce is simmering, cut 12 ounces long beans crosswise into 2-inch pieces (about 2 cups). Trim and cut 12 ounces Japanese or Chinese eggplants crosswise on a slight diagonal into 2-inch-long pieces that are about 1/2-inch thick (about 3 cups). Halve 12 ounces baby bok choy lengthwise through the core (quarter if large). Drain 1 (18-ounce) can banana hearts if using.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add the oxtails and short ribs to the sauce and gently stir to combine. Add the long beans, eggplant, bok choy, and banana hearts. Simmer, gently stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 10 to 20 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Serve with bagoong guisado if desired and steamed rice.
