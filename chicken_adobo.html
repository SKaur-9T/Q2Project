                        <h4>Filipino Chicken Adobo</h4>
                        <p>Growing up in a Filipino household meant that we ate classic Filipino recipes like adobo, the national dish of the Philippines, on a weekly basis</p>
                    </div>

                                Smash and peel 5 garlic cloves. Pat 3 pounds chicken thighs, drumsticks, or a combination dry with paper towels. Season all over with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil in a Dutch oven or large heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in 2 batches, add the chicken to the pot (skin-side down if using thighs). Sear until browned on all sides, about 6 minutes per batch (reduce the heat as needed if starting to burn). Transfer to a plate.

                            <li>
                                Place the garlic, 3 dried bay leaves, and 2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns in the pot. Stir until the garlic cloves and peppercorns are slightly toasted and fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 2 cups water, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup cane vinegar, and 3 tablespoons oyster sauce. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Return the chicken and any accumulated juices on the plate to the pot, arranging the chicken in a single layer (skin-side down if using thighs). Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook uncovered until the chicken registers at least 165ºF in the thickest part, flipping each piece over halfway through, about 20 minutes total. When the chicken is almost ready, arrange a rack in the upper-third of the oven and heat the oven to broil. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.

                            <li>
                                Using tongs, transfer the chicken (skin-side up if using thighs) to the baking sheet. Continue to let the sauce simmer on the stove. Broil the chicken until browned on top, about 3 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven, flip each piece, and brush with some of the sauce from the pot. Return the chicken to the oven and broil until browned on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Remove and discard the bay leaves if desired. Serve with steamed white rice and drizzle heavily with the sauce.

                                Add the beef and cook until the edges turn slightly brown. Pour in the soy sauce, star anise, five-spice, bay leaves, brown sugar, ground pepper and stir.

                                1 tablespoon cornstarch
                                Add 2 cups of the beef broth and the cornstarch slurry. Cover with the lid and bring to a simmer. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until the meat is very tender.

                                Divide into serving bowls, top with some roasted garlic and chopped green onions. Serve with fried garlic rice and bowl of the soup.
