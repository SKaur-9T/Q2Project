                                1 (about 12x16-inch) frozen pandan leaf

                            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>

                            <li>1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
                            <li>1 (7.6-ounce) can table cream or 8 ounces light cream</li>
                            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

                        <h4> Buko Pandan </h4>
                        <p>While desserts like halo-halo and even avocado con yelo (avocados mixed with ice, evaporated milk, and condensed milk) are time-tested favorites, I sometimes preferred the ready-to-serve kind that didnâ€™t require a shaved ice maker.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="process">
                        <h4>Process</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Let 1 frozen pandan leaf sit at room temperature until thawed, then tie into a knot.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Coat an 8x8-inch square metal pan with cooking spray. Line it with parchment paper along the bottom and over two opposite sides to create a sling. Gently wipe off any excess spray on the sides of the pan with a paper towel. (Alternatively, use a glass or ceramic 8x8-inch square pan, no need to coat with cooking spray or line with parchment.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Make the gulaman (jelly): Place the pandan knot, 1 1/2 cups coconut water, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, and 1 teaspoon agar-agar powder in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently with a heatproof spatula, until the mixture starts to boil and the agar-agar and sugar are dissolved 5 to 6 minutes. Continue to boil for 2 minutes more. Add 1 to 2 drops of green gel food coloring and stir to combine. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Discard the pandan leaf.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Immediately pour the mixture into the pan. Place the pan on a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Refrigerate uncovered until completely chilled, about 1 hour. Grasping the excess parchment paper, pull the gulaman slab out of the pan and place on a cutting board. Cut into flower shapes with a 1-inch flower cookie cutter or into 1/2-inch squares. (If you used a glass pan, just cut directly in the pan.)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Place 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, 1 (7.6-ounce) can table cream or 1 cup light cream, 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pandan extract in a large bowl and whisk until smooth. (If your extract is not green, you can add a few drops green gel food coloring to this mixture if you would like it to be green.) Add the gulaman and stir to combine.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Place a large colander set in the sink. Pour the contents of 1 (12-ounce) jar nata de coco in syrup, 1 (12-ounce) jar kaong in syrup, and 1 (20-ounce) can young coconut meat in syrup into the colander to drain. Cut the young coconut meat into bite-sized pieces with kitchen shears.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Transfer the contents of the colander to the bowl with the gulaman. Gently fold together with a flexible spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Serve cold.
